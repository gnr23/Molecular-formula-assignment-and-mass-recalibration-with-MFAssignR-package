\# Molecular Formula Assignment and Recalibration Workflow with MFAssignR

This workflow is designed for molecular formula assignment and recalibration of mass spectrometry data using the MFAssignR tool. It processes feature tables to generate recalibrated series, molecular formula assignments, and various diagnostic plots.

\#\# Workflow Steps

1\. \*\*Input Feature Table\*\*:

\- Accepts a feature table in tabular format containing mass spectrometry data.

2\. \*\*Molecular Formula Assignment\*\*:

\- Assigns molecular formulas to features based on mass-to-charge ratios and isotopic patterns.

3\. \*\*Recalibration\*\*:

\- Recalibrates mass spectrometry data to improve accuracy.

4\. \*\*Visualization\*\*:

\- Generates diagnostic plots, including:

\- Signal-to-noise (SN) plots.

\- Mass-to-charge (MZ) error plots.

\- Van Krevelen (VK) diagrams.

\- Molecular formula assignment plots.

\#\# Inputs

\- \*\*Feature Table\*\*: A tabular file containing mass spectrometry data. Example input: \`mfassignr_input.txt\`.

\#\# Outputs

\- \*\*Recalibrated Series\*\*:

\- \`recal_series.tabular\`: Recalibrated data series.

\- \`final_series.tabular\`: Final recalibrated series.

\- \*\*Molecular Formula Assignments\*\*:

\- \`Ambig.tabular\`: Ambiguous assignments.

\- \`Unambig.tabular\`: Unambiguous assignments.

\- \*\*Diagnostic Plots\*\*:

\- Signal-to-noise plot: \`SNplot.png\`.

\- Mass-to-charge error plot: \`MZplot.png\`.

\- Van Krevelen diagrams and molecular formula assignment plots for CHO and other elements.

\#\# Usage

This workflow is designed to be run on the Galaxy platform. Users can upload their feature table, configure parameters, and execute the workflow to obtain recalibrated data, molecular formula assignments, and diagnostic plots.
